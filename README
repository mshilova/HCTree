C++ program compress that will be invoked with a command line of the form

 ./compress infile outfile
When run, this program will read the contents of the file named by its first
command line argument, construct a Huffman code for the contents of that file, 
and use that code to construct a compressed version which is written to a file
named by the second command line argument. The input file can contain any data
(not just ASCII characters) so it should be treated as a binary file. 

 C++ program uncompress that will be invoked with a command line of the form

./uncompress infile outfile
When run, this program will read the contents of the file named by its first
command line argument, which should be a file that has been created by the
compress program. It will use the contents of that file to reconstruct the 
original, uncompressed version, which is written to a file named by the
second command line argument.
